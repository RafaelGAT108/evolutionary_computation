- dynamic_ident.txt: dynamic data used for models identification.
There are two columns: pumps speed (input) and system pressure
(output). The sampling time was 50ms.

- dynamic_test.txt: used for models test (validation). Same columns and sampling time as above.

- static.txt: measured data of the pumping system static curve. The columns represent the pumps speed and the output pressure.
